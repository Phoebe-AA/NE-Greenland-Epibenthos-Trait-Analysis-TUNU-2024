This GitHub account has been set up to be able to re-run all the analyses for 
"Diverging spatial patterns in trait diversity of epibenthic communities in fjord to slope habitats of the high Arctic" 
manuscript by Phoebe Armitage et al., 2023. 

READ ME
I encourage you to read this read me file before continuing with any analysis. 
I have outlined below how you can access the raw data and a brief description of the RMarkdown files 
found in this GitHub resource. 

DATA
All data (taxa abundance or biomass data, taxononmic trees (phy or P), traits, and environmental data)
are stored in R files, allData_A.R and allData_B.R. 
These can be downloaded and opened in R, where you will then have all of data frames in your global Environment. 
For .csv versions of the abundance, biomass, and trait data please visit https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10716116.
The RMarkdown files will guide you to be able to assign names for the downloaded files. 
See information on RMarkdown files below.  

CODE
The code has been broken down into three main RMarkdown files:
1) The biodiversity and functional indices
2) NMDS: analysis, statistics, and plotting. 
3) HMSC: Hierachical modelling of species communities. 

The third part (HMSC) is more complex and so it is not ideal to run in R on your laptop. 
For the analysis, we used CSC super computer where the analysis took 3-4 days to complete. 
For our batch code, we used the text "HMSC_batchjob.txt" and for the presence-absense
modelling you can see the code in HMSC_model_PA.R.
